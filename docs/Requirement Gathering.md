**Project 1: Login Page User Stories**

HIGH

- As a user, I would like to have a username and password so that I am
  able to secure my account.
- As a system administrator, I would like data to be stored in MongoDB
  so that it is easy to access.
- As a system administrator, I would like passwords to be hashed with
  the SHA256 algorithm so that they cannot be easily recovered.
- As a user, I would like to have a login page with a username,
  password, and login fields so that I am able to access my account.

MEDIUM

- As a system administrator, I would like users to follow password
  complexity requirements so that their accounts are more secure.
- As a user, I would like to be directed to the video gallery page
  upon login so that I am able to immediately begin enjoying content.
- As a system administrator, I would like user accounts to be locked
  after three failed login attempts so that user accounts are more
  secure.
- As a system administrator, I would like usernames to be valid email
  addresses so that I have a unique and consistent way to be able to
  contact users.

LOW

- As a system administrator, I would like users to email me to reset
  their password so that I am able to communicate with them securely.
- As a system administrator, I would like to manually provision
  accounts so that the complexity of the system can be kept to a
  minimum.
