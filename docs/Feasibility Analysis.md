**Project 1: Feasibility Analysis**

Across our team, we have experience with Node.JS ranging from entry
level to professional experience. Our experience with MongoDB,
however, is limited though this should not pose a large issue as its
client libraries are well documented and follow Node.JS best
practices.

We believe that this schedule is feasible, as the more experienced
developers can help to instruct and teach developers that may not have
the requisite topic knowledge. Throughout the course of the project,
the need for this instruction will decrease as all developers learn
the needed technologies. As we already have prior knowledge within our
team, it is not needed to hire an additional developer with prior
knowledge.

A training program will not be required as we have talent on our team
that is able to train others as needed. Additionally, free and open
sources such as the Mozilla Developer Network provides a significant
amount of information that can be referenced if needed.\
If a training program is needed for specialized skill, a Udemy
training program for all members on our team would be $419.97 ($139.99
/ team member).

As no more than $30k USD is wanted by the user to be spent towards the
completion of this project, resources have been priced accordingly,
and summary of expenses is provided below.

| Expense                                 | Cost           |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| 3x Node.JS Developers for 80 hours each | $13,039.20     |
| 4 core 16 GB AWS EC2 Instance           | $689.41        |
| **Total**                               | **$13,728.61** |

AWS was chosen over a dedicated server and associated system
administrator as the expense was significantly more cost effective.
The dedicated server solution would be priced at $62,000 / year, which
is prohibitively expensive for this projectâ€™s budget of $30,000. As no
additional training or employees are required, these expenses are not
listed.
